- multiple worlds test
- Sprite2DCloud - addChildAt - invalidation not THAT agressive if possible?
- Dynamic TextureAtlas. Packing algorithm: http://www.codeproject.com/KB/web-image/rectanglepacker.aspx. font from bmp / font from textfield? new Font2D class! with textureatlas http://ge.runcode.us/q/get-bounds-of-filters-applied-to-flash-sprite-within-sprite http://www.blackpawn.com/texts/lightmaps/
- Sprite2DBatch with multiple textures 4?
- iPhone retina management (assetloader, positions)
- convertTextureToBitmapData
- PARTICLESYSTEM2D rotation
- multiple cameras for scenes? splitscreen mode?

What I don't like about the spritesheets is:
- it's a pain to declare animations from a (cocos2D) spritesheet - it needs a simpler way like just sheet.playAnimation("foo*") and it would automatically build the animation with all assets named "foo001.png", "foo002.png", etc.

- Button2D
- Node2D.getBounds()
- animated masks

BitmapFont2D - Cocos2D font generator hiero, etc...

shader example: distortions

I think that would be better to have some API for adding custom parsers for TextureAtlas, since some people can't use Zwoptex (no Mac) or TexturePacker (too costly). Something like this:
TextureAtlas.registerParser(name:String, parser:ATextureAtlasParser):void;

linked lists instead of vector
